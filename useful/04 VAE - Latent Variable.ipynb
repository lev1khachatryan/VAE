    "Latent variables are variables that are part of the model, but which we donâ€™t observe, and are therefore not part of the dataset. We typically use $z$ to denote such latent variables. In case of unconditional modeling of observed variable $x$, the directed graphical model would then represent a joint distribution $p_{\\theta}(x, z)$ over both the observed variables $x$ and the latent variables $z$. The marginal distribution over the observed variables $p_{\\theta}(x)$, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$ p_{\\theta}(x) = \\int p_{\\theta}(x, z)dz $</center>\n",
    "Such an implicit distribution over $x$ can be quite flexible. If $z$ is discrete and $p_{\\theta}(x|z)$ is a Gaussian distribution, then $p_{\\theta}(x)$ is a mixture-of-Gaussians distribution. For continuous $z$, $p_{\\theta}(x)$ can be seen as an infinite mixture, which are potentially more powerful than discrete mixtures. Such marginal distributions are also called compound probability distributions."

    "We use the term ***deep latent variable model (DLVM)*** to denote a latent variable model $p_{\\theta}(x, z)$ whose distributions are parameterized by neural networks. Such a model can be conditioned on some context, like $p_{\\theta}(x, z|y)$. One important advantage of DLVMs, is that even when each factor (prior or conditional distribution) in the directed model is relatively simple (such as conditional Gaussian), the marginal distribution $p_{\\theta}(x)$ can be very complex, i.e. contain almost arbitrary dependencies. This expressivity makes deep latent-variable models attractive for approximating complicated underlying distributions $p^*(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest, and most common, DLVM is one that is specified as factorization with the following structure: \n",
    "<center>$ p_{\\theta}(x, z) = p_{\\theta}(z) p_{\\theta}(x|z) $</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_{\\theta}(z)$ and/or $p_{\\theta}(x|z)$ are specified. The distribution $p(z)$ is often called the ***prior distribution*** over $z$, since it is not conditioned on any observations."
